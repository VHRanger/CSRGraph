TODO:

- documentation // additional tests 
    predict_new 

- Best/fastest graph Embed algo 
     GLoVe? 
        on laplacian/adj/normed adj matrix? 
     Super simple optimization objective for unweighed graph 
         sum W^T * Wstar (f(x) and log(x) disappear) 

- TODOs in CSR (mmap, etc.) 

- beat node2vec at its own game 
    try UMAP, etc. 

- Make Graph Layout Optimizer 
    fast Glove with smart initial values? 
    Can be only a few passes
