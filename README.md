TODO:
     
- Re-work GLoVe

     current impl creates overlap between nodes embeddings?
     Should aim for better separation by reworking core math (see GLoVe paper)

- Embed Twitter
     
     Large Graph Reader // mmap if needed
     
- predict_new && test it

- Make Graph Layout Optimizer 

    fast Glove with smart initial values? 
    
    Can be only a few passes
